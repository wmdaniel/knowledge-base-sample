# knowledge-base-sample
This is a public example of my personal knowledge-base. Some of the content has been modified to give credit where credit is due.

This was originally created in a mix of Obsidian (with plugins, particularly `Templater`) and mostly written in vim.

Knowledge-base templates based on **M-Nelly** and **Alchemer**'s hard work. Stolen with permission from true friends.
